[new-volunter-project-screen.png]

On this screen, a new project can be created, complete with:
* **Project Title** (required identifier)
* **Project Description** 
* **Campaign** (option to associate with a [CiviCRM Campaign](http://book.civicrm.org/user/campaign/what-is-civicampaign/))

* **Location**: 

Select from a list, or _Create a new location_ for the project. If selected from a list, there is the option to _Edit Location_, which will be permanently saved after clicking **Save and Done**.)

There is also the ability to enable **Is this Project Active?**
This option is enabled (checked) by default. 

Disabling (un-checking) this option) will make the project invisible 
to potential volunteers searching for volunteer opportunities.

This is potentially useful for projects that are still in the planning phase, which should not allow potential volunteers to sign up, just yet.

* **Relationships: Owner, Manager, Beneficiary**

These relationships are specific to CiviVolunteer, and are self-documented on this screen as to their intended usage. If necessary, [learn how CiviCRM handles Relationships](http://book.civicrm.org/user/organising-your-data/relationships/).

* **Volunteer Registration**

* **The first selection menu** is a list of [CiviCRM Profiles](http://book.civicrm.org/user/organising-your-data/profiles/), and few special profiles that have been added specifically for CiviVolunteer (such as Volunteer Sign Up).

The magnifying glass icon to the right allows a quick preview of the resulting form from that selected Profile.

* **Use For:** Individual Registration, Group Registration, or Both

_Individual Registration_ will use the selected Profile to collect information when registering a single Individual.

_Group Registration_ will use the selected Profile to collect information when registering multiple Individuals on the same page.

_Both_ will use the the selected Profile for all volunteer sign-ups, whether through Individual or Group registration.

* add another profile

CiviVolunteer will allow as many Profiles as desired for a single Volunteer Project, configured individually via the **Use For:** options. Profiles can be added or removed from this page. 

Clicking **Save and Done** will save the Project and take the user to the **Manage Volunteer Projects** screen.
Clicking **Continue** will save the Project and take the user to the **Needs** screen, which can also be accessed from **Manage Volunteer Projects** > **Define Needs**.
