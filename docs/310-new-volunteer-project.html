<p>From the <b>Volunteer</b> menu, clicking on <b>New Volunteer Project</b> yields:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/screenshots/new-volunter-project-screen.png" alt="New Volunteer Project Screen" /><p/>


<p>On this screen, a new project can be created, complete with:</p>

<p><b>Project Title</b> (required identifier)</p>
<p><b>Project Description</b></p>
<p><b>Campaign</b> (option to associate with a <a href="http://book.civicrm.org/user/campaign/what-is-civicampaign">CiviCRM Campaign</a></p>


<p><b>Location</b>:</p>


<p>Select from a list, or <em>Create a new location</em> for the project. If selected from a list, there is the option to <em>Edit Location</em>, which will be permanently saved after clicking <b>Save and Done</b>.)</p>

<p>There is also the ability to enable <b>Is this Project Active?</b>
This option is enabled (checked) by default. </p>

<p>Disabling (un-checking) this option) will make the project invisible 
to potential volunteers searching for volunteer opportunities.</p>

<p>This is potentially useful for projects that are still in the planning phase, which should not allow potential volunteers to sign up, just yet.</p>


<b>Relationships: Owner, Manager, Beneficiary</b>


<p>These relationships are specific to CiviVolunteer, and are self-documented on this screen as to their intended usage. If necessary, [learn how CiviCRM handles Relationships](http://book.civicrm.org/user/organising-your-data/relationships/).</p>


<p><b>Volunteer Registration</b></p>



<p><b>The first selection menu</b> is a list of [CiviCRM Profiles](http://book.civicrm.org/user/organising-your-data/profiles/), and few special profiles that have been added specifically for CiviVolunteer (such as Volunteer Sign Up).</p>


<p>The magnifying glass icon to the right allows a quick preview of the resulting form from that selected Profile.</p>


<p><b>Use For:</b> Individual Registration, Group Registration, or Both</p>


<p><em>Individual Registration</em> will use the selected Profile to collect information when registering a single Individual.</p>

<p><em>Group Registration</em> will use the selected Profile to collect information when registering multiple Individuals on the same page.</p>

<p><em>Both</em> will use the the selected Profile for all volunteer sign-ups, whether through Individual or Group registration.</p>


<p><b>(+) add another profile</b></p>


<p>CiviVolunteer will allow as many Profiles as desired for a single Volunteer Project, 
  configured individually via the <b>Use For:</b> options. Profiles can be added or removed from this page. 
</p>

<p>Clicking <b>Save and Done</b> will save the Project and take the user to the <b>Manage Volunteer Projects</b> screen.</p>

<p>Clicking <b>Continue</b> will save the Project and take the user to the <b>Needs</b> screen, which can also be accessed from <b>Manage Volunteer Projects</b> > <b>Define Needs</b>.
