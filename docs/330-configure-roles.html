<p>
  From the <b>Volunteers</b> menu, clicking on <b>Configure Roles</b> yields:
</p>

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/screenshots/configure-roles-screen.png" alt="Configure Roles Screen" />
</p>

<p>
  The Roles configured from this screen are used directly when defining volunter project needs for a specific project in:<br/>
  Volunteers > Manage Volunteer Projects > Define Needs
</p>

<p>
  Most CiviCRM users will find this screen to be intuitive. 
  <ul>
    <b>Label</b>: can be edited by clicking on it directly.
    <b>Value</b>: should only be edited by advanced users, as it may affect relationships to other data in CiviVolunteer and CiviCRM.
    <b>Description</b>: can be edited by clicking on it directly.
    <b>Order</b>: the buttons can be used in a familiar way to order to the top, bottom, or move up or down one in the list.
    <b>Reserved</b>: determines if the Role can be deleted or disabled, not editable.
    <b>Enabled</b>: determines whether or not this Role will show up in dropdowns for selection in CiviVolunteer, not editable directly.
  </ul>
  There are also links to the right for each Role.
  <ul>
    <b>Edit</b>: brings up a dialog to edit the Label, Value, and Order manually (specifying a number), as well as allow for a rich-text description.
    <b>Disable</b>: brings up a confirmation dialog to ensure this is the intended action, and if confirmed will disable the Role.
    <b>Delete</b>: brings up a dialog to ensure this is the intended action, and if confirmed will delete the Role from CiviVolunteer completely.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  New Roles can be created by clicking on the <b>+ Add Volunteer Role</b> button at the bottom left of the dialog. This will bring up a screen identical to the <b>Edit</b> dialog for an existing Role, with some information pre-propulated.
