title: Volunteer Interest Form
---
<p>
  As of version 1.4, CiviVolunteer provides a public-facing Volunteer Interest
  Form. The purpose of this form is to allow potential volunteers to express
  interest in volunteering for your organization without signing up for a
  specific volunteer opportunity. This is useful if your organization doesn't
  have any volunteer opportunities listed at the time of the potential
  volunteer's visit, or if none of them are appropriate for the individual in
  question. This form allows you to collect whatever information you choose
  about potential volunteers, from basic contact information to self-assessments
  of ability in various skill areas.
</p>
<p>
  To see the form, choose <strong>Volunteers &gt; Volunteer Interest
  Form</strong> from the menu. To encourage use of the form, you should link to
  it from your website, as potential volunteers won't have access to CiviCRM's
  administrative menu. Without additional configuration, the interest form
  will look something like this:

<h2>Configuring the Volunteer Interest Form</h2>
<p>
  At its core, the Volunteer Interest Form is nothing more than a
  <a href="http://gitbook.civicrm.org/organising-your-data/profiles.html">CiviCRM
  profile</a> with a fancy URL. (Since Drupal doesn't provide site
  administrators an easy way to display a Profile at a custom URL, CiviVolunteer
  supplies the http://example.org/civicrm/volunteer/join URL for this; WordPress
  users may find this feature unnecessary.)
</p>
<p>
  You can customize the fields in the Volunteer Interest Form by selecting
  <strong>Administer &gt; Customize Data and Screens &gt; Profiles</strong>
  from the menu and editing the <strong>Notify Me of Volunteer
  Opportunities</strong> Profile.
</p>
<h2>Collecting Skills or Interest on a Continuum</h2>

</p>
<p>
  As of version 1.4, CiviVolunteer provides a slider widget for multi-select fields
  where the option list represents a continuum. The options in the multi-select list
  are converted to stops on a slider. Items with a lower weight in the option
  group will appear on the left side of the slider, while heavily weighted
  items will appear on the right.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  The Skill Level option group that ships with CiviVolunteer demonstrates the
  benefit of this feature. When a user drags the slider, the current option
  (e.g., <strong>Master</strong>) as well as all options with a lower weight are
  selected. As a result, a search for volunteers qualified to do
  <strong>Apprentice</strong>-level work will include volunteers with
  <strong>Master</strong>-level skills.
</p>
<p>
  To enable this widget for a
  <a href="http://gitbook.civicrm.org/organising-your-data/creating-custom-fields.html">Custom
  Field</a>, select <strong>Alphanumeric Multi-Select</strong> as the
  <strong>Data and Input Field Type</strong> for the field. When these
  selections are made, a checkbox labeled <strong>Use Slider Selector?</strong>
  will appear. Check it and save the field, and your select list will be
  rendered as slider widget.
