  From the <b>Volunteers</b> menu, clicking on <b>Search for Volunteer Opportunites</b> yields:
</p>

<p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/screenshots/search-volunteer-opportunities-screen.png" alt="Search Volunteer Opportunites Screen" />
</p>

<p>
  On this screen, the user may:
  <ul>
    <li>Search for available volunteer opportunites using various criteria.</li>
    <li>View a list of volunteer opportunities.</li>
    <li>Sign Up for multiple opportunities at once.</li>
  <ul>
</p>

<p>
  Searching for available volunteer opportunites can be accomplished using the top-left portion of the screen. Volunteer opportunities can be searched for using any number of criteria (or by specifying no criteria to view the entire unfiltered list).
</p> 
<p>
  Basic searches can be performed by
  <ul>
    <li>Event Time (Between {Earlier Date} and {Later Date} in a Date Range)</li>
    <li>Role (which corresponds to the configured Volunteer Roles)</li>
    <li>Beneficiary (which corresponds to the Beneficiary set for a given Volunteer Project when it was created/edited)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  A more advanced search can include a Proximity Search, which may be obtained by clicking the triangular button to the left.
  The search can be calibrated to be within a certain number of miles/kilomneters of a given location (Country and Within are required fields).
  Additionally, the user may narrow the search by City, Zip Code, or Street Address.
</p>
<p>
  Once the Search button is clicked, a list of volunter opportunities will appear as search results at the bottom of the screen. The Project Name, Beneficiary, Role, and Time will be displayed, along with a <b>Sign Up</b> checkbox for the user to "check".
</p>
<p>
  For each <b>Sign Up</b> checkbox that is checked, an entry will appear in the top right corner of the screen. The trash icon to the right of each entry will allow the user to remove that entry for the current batch of Sign-Ups. Once the list has been finalized to the user's liking, the <b>Sign Up!</b> button may be clicked, and a confirmation will appear that that user has been signed up for the selected opportunities.
