# Events

If you have an event and need volunteers as well, you can check the
'Enable Volunteer Management' box to get started.

Q: Can you change the text on the button for signing up, as is possible
for Online registration ïƒ  e.g. instead of Volunteer now change the
button into 'Join us' etc.

Check the 'Enable Volunteer Management' box to get started.

Add all the information as you did in Chapter 6. The difference is that
when people see the event page they will see the button Register Now (if
there are online registrations possible) and a button 'Volunteer Now'.
