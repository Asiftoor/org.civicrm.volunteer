# Search for Volunteer Opportunities

**Self-service Volunteer Signup**

Once you've defined your volunteer needs, you can decide to include a
volunteer signup form as part of your public event. A "Volunteer Now"
button will appear on your event info page (next to the "Register"
button). Volunteers can select a shift, or let you know that they are
available for any shift. You will need to enable the "*CiviVolunteer:
register to volunteer permission*" if you want to provide self-service
signup for anonymous and / or authenticated users, and also check the
box "CiviCRM : Access Ajax- Api"

From the **Volunteers** menu, clicking on **Search for Volunteer
Opportunities** yields:

The 'Commitments' window will move with you as you scroll along all the
volunteer opportunities so that at all time you can see for how many
shifts you have signed up.

If you want to change the content of this screen or translate certain
words you can do that ...... where?

On this screen, the user may:

* Search for available volunteer opportunities using various criteria
* View a list of volunteer opportunities
* Sign up for multiple opportunities at once
* Searching for available opportunities can be accomplished using the
top-left portion of the screen. Volunteer opportunities can be searched
for using a number of criteria (of by specifying no criteria to view the
entire unfiltered list)
* Basic searches can be performed by:
* Event Time (between {Earlier Date} and {Later Date} in a Date Range)
* Role (which corresponds to the configured Volunteer Roles)
* Benificiary (which corresponds to the Beneficiary set for a given
Volunteer Project when it was created/edited)

A more advanced search can include a Proximity Search, which may be
obtained by clicking the triangular button to the left. The search can
calibrated to be within a certain number of miles/kilometres of a given
location (Country and Within are required fields). Additionally, the
user may narrow the search by City, Zip Code of Street Address.

Once the Search button is clicked, a list of Volunteer opportunities
will appear as search results at the bottom of the screen. The Project
Name, Beneficiary, Role and Time will be displayed, along with a **Sign
Up** checkbox for the user to 'check'

For each **Sign Up** checkbox that is checked, an entry will appear in
the top right corner of the screen. The trash icon to the right of each
entry will allow the user to remove that entry for the current batch of
Sign-Ups. Once the list has been finalized to the user's liking, the
**Sign Up!** Button may be clicked, and a confirmation will appear that
that user has been signed up for the selected opportunities.

The volunteer receives an email containing information about the
projects and shifts.
